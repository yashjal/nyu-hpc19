HW4 Report

1) The implementation of the matrix-vector multiplication involves an element-wise vector product of each row of the matrix
   with the the given vector and a subsequent reduction of each of the element-wise products. The following results are run 
   on cims cuda servers (which share resources such as GPU, so optimal performance may not have been reached) with N = 2^16
   and block size of 1024.

   On cims cuda1 with GPU GeForce GTX TITAN Black (6 GB memory):
    CPU Bandwidth = 85.496673 GB/s
    GPU Bandwidth = 211.953422 GB/s
    Error = 0.000000 
  
   On cims cuda3 with GPU TITAN V (12 GB memory):
    


   On cims cuda4 with GPU GeForce GTX TITAN X (12 GB memory):

   On cims cuda5 with GPU GeForce GTX TITAN Z (12 GB memory):
